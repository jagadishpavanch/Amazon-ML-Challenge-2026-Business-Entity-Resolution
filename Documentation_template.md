## 1. Executive Summary
This submission presents an end-to-end, reproducible, 100% offline machine learning pipeline for the Amazon ML Challenge 2026 Business Entity Resolution task. Our system resolves noisy, multi-source commercial entity fragments (Source 2 & Source 3) against deduplicated reference business records (Source 1) using only name, address, and country fields, optimized for the **macro-averaged per-entity $F_{0.5}$** metric (precision weighted 2× over recall, singletons scored 1.0/0.0). Key innovations include: (1) a multi-strategy, country-partitioned candidate blocking engine achieving **96.31% pair completeness** while eliminating $>99.93\%$ of the cross-product space, (2) a deterministic 27-dimensional pairwise feature vector spanning multi-script token sort, partial edit distances, and structured subfield agreement, (3) an **XGBoost pairwise classifier (Apache-2.0 License)** trained with grouped cross-validation and class imbalance weighting, (4) an empirical decision threshold optimization tuned directly on validation macro $F_{0.5}$ ($0.940 - 0.950$), and (5) a **Stage 7 Global Consistency conflict resolution** step exploiting the verified physical domain constraint that candidate fragments map to at most one reference entity.

## 2. Methodology

### 2.1 Problem Analysis

During exploratory data analysis across the 2.2M reference entities and 10.3M source fragments, we identified seven fundamental noise archetypes and key structural properties:
1. **Singleton Dominance & Evaluation Dynamics:** Exactly **5.58%** (123,247 / 2,206,821) of Source 1 entities have zero true matches in Source 2/3. Predicting an empty list on singletons earns a score of 1.0, while false merges earn 0.0. The trivial baseline of predicting all singletons yields a macro $F_{0.5}$ of **0.05585**.
2. **Cardinality Law:** In the ground truth, exactly **0.00%** of Source 2 or Source 3 fragments are associated with multiple Source 1 entities (strictly 1-to-at-most-1 cardinality).
3. **Open-String Country Distribution & Unseen France:** True matches never cross country boundaries (0 / 336,135 ground truth pairs checked crossed countries). Training data contains only `US` (59.98%) and `India` (40.02%), while the test set introduces `France` (14.98%, ~259k S1 entities and ~1.43M S2/S3 fragments). The pipeline avoids hardcoded categorical branching, processing all countries uniformly.
4. **Noise Archetypes Cataloged:**
   - *Legal Suffix Inconsistencies:* 62.75% of business names contain corporate suffixes (`Corp`, `Corporation`, `Pvt Ltd`, `LLC`, `SARL`, `SAS`).
   - *Multi-Script Transliteration:* Indian records frequently feature English in S1 but Devanagari (`एसएस फूड`), Tamil (`ராஜ்`), or Gujarati in S2/S3. Direct name similarity drops below 15%, but address token overlap remains high ($>85\%$), necessitating address-dominant candidate generation.
   - *Token Reordering:* Names and addresses frequently transpose words (e.g. `Tiena L. Hamilton, DDS` vs `dds l. hamilton, tiena`; `31415 Orchard Hill Lane` vs `Orchard Hill Lane... 31415`).
   - *Typographical & OCR Noise:* Transposed or dropped characters (e.g. `Payne Enterprises` vs `Payne Enterpires`).
   - *Missing Address Components:* Address lengths vary drastically (often match length is $<30\%$ of reference).
   - *Informal Landmarks:* 4.31% of addresses contain landmark prepositions (`Near Fortis Hospital`, `Opp Bharata Mata College`, `Behind Oxford School`).

### 2.2 Solution Strategy
**Approach Type:** Hybrid Multi-Strategy Blocking + Gradient Boosted Pairwise Classifier + Global 1-to-Many Conflict Resolution.  
**Core Innovation:** A dual-pillar candidate generation mechanism that pairs order-invariant name token indexing with spatial address shingle/number co-occurrence, combined with domain-enforced global consistency resolution that mathematically eliminates multi-entity fragment conflicts.

## 3. Candidate Generation (Blocking)

To reduce the $1.73\text{M} \times 9.97\text{M} \approx 17.2\text{ Trillion}$ test comparison space into a tractable set of candidate pairs, we implement four complementary blocking strategies partitioned by country string:

- **Blocking Strategies Used:**
  1. *Strategy 1 — Distinctive Name Tokens:* Inverted index on normalized root name tokens (length $\ge 3$, excluding high-frequency entity stopwords like `inc`, `ltd`, `corp`, `services`).
  2. *Strategy 2 — Street Number + Locality Prefix:* Inverted index on extracted street/building number combined with the 4-character prefix of the first significant street word (captures transliterated names where Latin and Devanagari names differ completely but physical street numbers match).
  3. *Strategy 3 — Address Token Co-Occurrence Pairs:* Index on pairs of rare locality tokens (frequency-ranked), capturing rural or Indian addresses lacking municipal house numbers.
  4. *Strategy 4 — Name Prefix + Locality Prefix:* First 4 letters of name + first 3 letters of address (recovers severe name typos and minor address modifications).
- **Candidate Volume & Reduction Ratio:**
  - Evaluated on 10,000 validation entities against 184,015 candidate pool records:
  - Total candidate pairs generated: 1,130,246 (average 113.0 candidates per S1 entity).
  - Full cross-product comparison space: $1,840,150,000$.
  - **Reduction Ratio:** **99.9386%** space reduction.
- **How True Matches Were Preserved:**
  - True pairs captured: 33,239 out of 34,511 true matches.
  - **Pair Completeness (Recall Ceiling):** **96.31%**.

1. **Name Similarity Features:**
   - Levenshtein ratio (`rapidfuzz.fuzz.ratio`)
   - Partial ratio (`rapidfuzz.fuzz.partial_ratio`)

   - Jaro-Winkler similarity (`rapidfuzz.distance.JaroWinkler.similarity`) — prefix-weighted similarity
   - Root name ratio & root name Jaro-Winkler (after stripping legal designations)
   - Transliterated ASCII token sort ratio & root sort ratio (cross-script Indic-Latin bridge)
   - First-token brand exact match, fuzzy ratio, and Jaro-Winkler
   - Name token overlap coefficient $\frac{|T_1 \cap T_2|}{\min(|T_1|, |T_2|)}$ and word Jaccard
   - Character 2-gram and 3-gram Jaccard similarities
   - Exact match boolean flag (`norm_name_1 == norm_name_2`) & root exact match flag
   - 3-character prefix match flag
   - Name length difference & length ratio
   - Business name digit exact match, mismatch, and signed flags (e.g. `Local 579`, `Studio 54`)
2. **Legal Suffix Agreement:**
   - Both entities have legal suffix flag
   - Legal suffix exact match flag (canonical expansion via multilingual lookup table)
3. **Address Similarity Features:**
   - Full address Levenshtein ratio & partial ratio
   - Address token sort ratio & token set ratio
   - Address Jaro-Winkler similarity
   - Address word-level Jaccard similarity & token overlap coefficient
   - Address character 2-gram and 3-gram Jaccard similarities
   - Address length difference
4. **Structured Subfield Agreement Flags:**

   - Postal code hierarchical prefix matches: prefix-3 (district/metro level) and prefix-2 (state/region level)
   - Street number exact match, mismatch, and signed flags
   - Logarithmic street number distance: $\ln(1 + |\text{num}_1 - \text{num}_2|)$
   - Landmark match flag (similarity on isolated landmark string $> 80\%$)
   - Domain / website string inclusion flag
5. **Nonlinear Interaction & Composite Signals:**
   - Harmonic mean of name and address token set ratios: $\frac{2 \times S_{\text{name}} \times S_{\text{addr}}}{S_{\text{name}} + S_{\text{addr}} + \epsilon}$
   - Weakest-link minimum: $\min(S_{\text{name}}, S_{\text{addr}})$
   - Product interaction: $(S_{\text{name}} \times S_{\text{addr}}) / 10000$
   - Disagreement penalty: $|S_{\text{name}} - S_{\text{addr}}|$
   - Maximum name similarity across raw, root, and transliterated representations
   - Weighted composite alignment score ($0.45 \times S_{\text{name}} + 0.45 \times S_{\text{addr}} + 10.0 \times \text{postal\_exact}$)
   - High dual similarity boolean indicator ($S_{\text{name}} \ge 80 \land S_{\text{addr}} \ge 80$)

### Model Architecture & Hyperparameters:
- **Model Type:** Tri-Model Gradient Boosted Ensemble combining:
  1. **XGBoost (Apache-2.0 License):** Depth-wise histogram splitting (weight: 0.40).
  2. **LightGBM (MIT License):** Leaf-wise / best-first gradient-based one-side sampling (weight: 0.35).
  3. **CatBoost (Apache-2.0 License):** Oblivious / symmetric decision trees (weight: 0.25).
- **Ensemble Parameter Count:** ~10,000 tree decision nodes combined ($< 0.0001\%$ of the $\le 8\text{B}$ constraint).
- **Validation Splitting:** 5-Fold `GroupKFold` grouped strictly by Source 1 entity ID, ensuring that candidate pairs for any reference entity never appear in both training and validation folds.
- **Imbalance Handling:** Calibrated square-root ratio weighting ($\text{scale\_pos\_weight} \approx 3.13$), preventing sigmoid probability saturation and preserving smooth probability ranking for threshold optimization.
- **Top Feature Importances:**
  1. `addr_token_set` (0.6410) — strongest predictor of physical co-location.
  2. `addr_word_jaccard` (0.0884) — penalizes contradictory street names.
  3. `name_token_sort` (0.0345) — handles transposed brand terms.
  4. `root_name_ratio` (0.0312) — isolates core brand identity from corporate suffixes.
  5. `harmonic_name_addr` (0.0270) — enforces balanced name and address agreement.

### Decision Threshold Selection & Singleton Handling:
- The decision threshold was tuned via grid sweep on out-of-fold validation predictions directly maximizing macro-averaged $F_{0.5}$:
$$F_{0.5} = \frac{1.25 \times \text{Precision} \times \text{Recall}}{0.25 \times \text{Precision} + \text{Recall}}$$
- Singletons score 1.0 when predicted empty and 0.0 otherwise.
- Optimal global decision threshold: **$\tau^* = 0.830$**.
- Entities with no surviving candidates above $\tau^*$ are explicitly designated as singletons (empty list).
